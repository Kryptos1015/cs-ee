    "text = '''It would be hard to find any reputable literary critic today who would care\n",
    "to be caught defending as an idea the old antithesis of style versus content.\n",
    "On this issue a pious consensus prevails. Everyone is quick to avow that\n",
    "style and content are indissoluble, that the strongly individual style of each\n",
    "important writer is an organic aspect of his work and never something\n",
    "merely “decorative.”\n",
    "In the practice of criticism, though, the old antithesis lives on, virtually\n",
    "unassailed. Most of the same critics who disclaim, in passing, the notion\n",
    "that style is an accessory to content maintain the duality whenever they\n",
    "apply themselves to particular works of literature. It is not so easy, after all,\n",
    "to get unstuck from a distinction that practically holds together the fabric of\n",
    "critical discourse, and serves to perpetuate certain intellectual aims and\n",
    "vested interests which themselves remain unchallenged and would be\n",
    "difficult to surrender without a fully articulated working replacement at\n",
    "hand.\n",
    "In fact, to talk about the style of a particular novel or poem at all as a\n",
    "“style,” without implying, whether one wishes to or not, that style is merely\n",
    "decorative, accessory, is extremely hard. Merely by employing the notion,\n",
    "one is almost bound to invoke, albeit implicitly, an antithesis between style\n",
    "and something else. Many critics appear not to realize this. They think\n",
    "themselves sufficiently protected by a theoretical disclaimer on the vulgar\n",
    "filtering-off of style from content, all the while their judgments continue to\n",
    "reinforce precisely what they are, in theory, eager to deny.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way in which the old duality lives on in the practice of criticism, in\n",
    "concrete judgments, is the frequency with which quite admirable works of\n",
    "art are defended as good although what is miscalled their style is\n",
    "acknowledged to be crude or careless. Another is the frequency with which\n",
    "a very complex style is regarded with a barely concealed ambivalence.\n",
    "Contemporary writers and other artists with a style that is intricate,\n",
    "hermetic, demanding—not to speak of “beautiful”—get their ration of\n",
    "unstinting praise. Still, it is clear that such a style is often felt to be a form\n",
    "of insincerity: evidence of the artist's intrusion upon his materials, which\n",
    "should be allowed to deliver themselves in a pure state.\n",
    "Whitman, in the preface to the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass,\n",
    "expresses the disavowal of “style” which is, in most arts since the last\n",
    "century, a standard ploy for ushering in a new stylistic vocabulary. “The\n",
    "greatest poet has less a marked style and is more the free channel of\n",
    "himself,” that great and very mannered poet contends. “He says to his art, I\n",
    "will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance or\n",
    "effect or originality to hang in the way between me and the rest like\n",
    "curtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest curtains. What\n",
    "I tell I tell for precisely what it is.”\n",
    "Of course, as everyone knows or claims to know, there is no neutral,\n",
    "absolutely transparent style. Sartre has shown, in his excellent review of\n",
    "The Stranger, how the celebrated “white style” of Camus' novel—\n",
    "impersonal, expository, lucid, flat—is itself the vehicle of Meursault's\n",
    "image of the world (as made up of absurd, fortuitous moments). What\n",
    "Roland Barthes calls “the zero degree of writing” is, precisely by being\n",
    "anti-metaphorical and dehumanized, as selective and artificial as any\n",
    "traditional style of writing. Nevertheless, the notion of a style-less,\n",
    "transparent art is one of the most tenacious fantasies of modern culture.\n",
    "Artists and critics pretend to believe that it is no more possible to get the\n",
    "artifice out of art than it is for a person to lose his personality. Yet the\n",
    "aspiration lingers—a permanent dissent from modern art, with its dizzying\n",
    "velocity of style changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speak of style is one way of speaking about the totality of a work of art.\n",
    "Like all discourse about totalities, talk of style must rely on metaphors. And\n",
    "metaphors mislead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take, for instance, Whitman's very material metaphor. By likening style\n",
    "to a curtain, he has of course confused style with decoration and for this\n",
    "would be speedily faulted by most critics. To conceive of style as a\n",
    "decorative encumbrance on the matter of the work suggests that the curtain\n",
    "could be parted and the matter revealed; or, to vary the metaphor slightly,\n",
    "that the curtain could be rendered transparent, o. But this is not the only\n",
    "erroneous implication of the metaphor. What the metaphor also suggests is\n",
    "that style is a matter of more or less (quantity), thick or thin (density). And,\n",
    "though less obviously so, this is just as wrong as the fancy that an artist\n",
    "possesses the genuine option to have or not to have a style. Style is not\n",
    "quantitative, any more than it is superadded. A more complex stylistic\n",
    "convention—say, one taking prose further away from the diction and\n",
    "cadences of ordinary speech—does not mean that the work has “more”\n",
    "style.\n",
    "Indeed, practically all metaphors for style amount to placing matter on\n",
    "the inside, style on the outside. Indeed.'''"
